# AutoBongoChestClicks

After I started using Bongo Cat, I really enjoyed the loot chest mechanic and the cosmetic rewards — especially being able to sell them on the Steam marketplace.

However, I ran into a small problem: whenever I’m working (coding, writing, or doing something creative), I have to stop what I’m doing just to click the loot chest. It’s a small interruption, but it adds up.

That’s when I thought — why not make a lightweight tool that clicks for me when a specific image shows up? This way, I can stay focused and keep working without distractions.

So I built a simple desktop utility using Python — a platform I know and love.
